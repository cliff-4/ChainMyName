# ChainMyName

<!-- `main.py` takes in a text file of a (say) blog and generates some questions based on that blog using a model (`text-davinci-003` used for our use case). -->

Key points
- User has to provide BOTH text document and number of questions. 
- Eval time is kept in record
- Document to be uploaded contains a blog post in a text file
- Currently the upper limit to number of questions is kept to 10 so as to not have an overflow in the database limit
- CSS and styling can be changed in future according to needs
- The GIF is 2x slower compared to real life recording
