Creating directories (mkdir command)
Last Updated: 2023-03-24
Use the mkdir command to create one or more directories specified by the Directory parameter.

Each new directory contains the standard entries dot (.) and dot dot (..). You can specify the permissions for the new directories with the -m Mode flag.

When you create a directory, it is created within the current, or working, directory unless you specify an absolute path name to another location in the file system.

The following are examples of how to use the mkdir command:
To create a new directory called Test in the current working directory with default permissions, type the following:
mkdir Test

To create a directory called Test with rwxr-xr-x permissions in a previously created /home/demo/sub1 directory, type the following:
mkdir -m 755 /home/demo/sub1/Test

To create a directory called Test with default permissions in the /home/demo/sub2 directory, type the following:
mkdir -p /home/demo/sub2/Test

The -p flag creates the /home, /home/demo, and /home/demo/sub2 directories if they do not already exist.
See the mkdir command in the Commands Reference, Volume 3 for the complete syntax.
